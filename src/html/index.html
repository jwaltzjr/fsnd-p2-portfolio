        <p>In this project a python script is used to store a list of movie objects and their youtube trailers. It then uses an API to generate the poster image, plot description, and cast to display on the website. The HTML, CSS, and JS that was used was mostly provided by Udacity, although minor changes were made to include more information.</p>

        <p>This project uses grunt to generate a fully responsive portfolio website based on a provided design markup. Some liberties were taken on the design, as the focus of this project was using the bootstrap framework and responsive css practices (including responsive images) to create a website that looks good on all devices.</p>
